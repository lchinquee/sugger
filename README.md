## Challenge Description
  This challenge, assigned by Rutgers Coding Bootcamp, required the update of an existing Budget Tracker application to save data when an internet connection is lost and submit that saved data to the server when an internet connection is re-established.

## Built With
  * HTML
  * CSS
  * JavaScript
  * Node.js
  * Express.js
  * IndexedDB
  * MongoDB

## Installation
  In order to view the database the user must install Node.js on their PC, initialize Node in the command line, and install the files from package.json.

## Usage
  The user can access the Budget Tracker via the Heroku link provided in the `Links` section of this README. There, the user can track their budget by entering expense/deposit information into the tracker. If internet connection is lost, the app will cache the saved data until an internet connection is re-established.
